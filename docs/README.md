This is a modded Minecraft Server running Forge with Feed-The-Beast extensions for server management. This is a primarily tech-themed modpack. Spawn is a slowly-evolving Minecolonies Village.

## Version 1.16.5 - The Nether Update
- [1.16.5](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.16.5) is a minor update to Java Edition released on January 15, 2021, which fixes issues related to server crashes.
- [1.16](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.16), the first release of the Nether Update, is a major update to Java Edition announced at MINECON Live 2019 and released on June 23, 2020. This update overhauls the Nether by adding four new biomes, four new mobs (the piglin, hoglin, zoglin, and strider), and a multitude of new blocks, including many variants of blackstone as well as the respawn anchor used to set the player's spawnpoint in the Nether. It also adds a new netherite tier of equipment, obtained through ancient debris found rarely throughout the Nether.

### Get Minecraft
To run Minecraft on your computer, you will need Java version 8 or higher and a Minecraft launcher:
- [Java SE 8 Development Kit](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
- Microsoft's [Minecraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft) or the OpenSource program [PolyMC](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC).

We are using the **Java** version of Minecraft, **not** the Bedrock version. <br />
As of this writing, Microsoft will let you download both versions when you set up your account.

If you already have a Mojang account, Microsoft will insist that you transfer to a Microsoft account. **You will not be able to use your mxSchool email address for this.** Please create a new Microsoft account or use a personal gmail address. Learn more about migrating a Mojang account from [the Minecraft Help Centre](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/4403181904525-How-to-Migrate-Your-Mojang-Account-to-a-Microsoft-Account)

Once you run Minecraft, choose multiplayer and add the multiplayer server URL: **robotics.mxschool.edu**
